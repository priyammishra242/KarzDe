                In addition, your loan request has been successfully submitted to our system for considering. The whole approval process might take 
                approximately 10-20 working days. After that, approval results will be sent to the notification box of your account. Please login and check your

                In case of a successful approval, a loan contract will be sent to you. By law, you will have 7 days for judging the loan contract. After that, we 
                would like to ask you to digitally sign the final loan contract and send it back to us within 2 months. As soon as we receive the loan contract with 
                your digital signature, the loan will be properly settled and valid.
